# Is it too windy to bike today?

Chicago is damn windy.  I am probably not the only person who wants to not die in traffic, so I decided to make a very simple website to help cyclists quickly determine if they can safely commute.

This project is in Python and PHP because I need to learn these languages for a job.  I recognize this is not the most practical way I could have done this.
