# MVP
* user types in zip code
* script converts zip to lat lon, gives back highest wind speed before midnight
* use API/script to get yes or no answer
* tell highest wind speed in next
* prevents >1000 number of API calls/day
* deploy to AWS

<!-- default home page: -->
  <!-- Is it too windy to bike today?  Enter your zip code. -->
  <!-- [zip code entry box] -->
<!-- home page with url params: -->
  <!-- check if wind > 15 mph, YES or NO -->
  <!-- The highest predicted wind speed between now and midnight for your zip code is  -->
  <!-- bookmark this page! -->

# Stretch
* get zip code automatically based on user location
* user can set what-is-too-windy level
* include warnings/alerts
* chart with hourly wind speed for rest of day
* additional info-- "no but it might be too snowy"
